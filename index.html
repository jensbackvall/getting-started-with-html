Basic concepts</p>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Web</b>
<br>
The World Wide Web... what is it really?
<br>
As the name suggests, it is a kind of web, where millions of computers are linked up by web-like connections
through wires, fibres, sattelites etc.
<br>
When I turn on my computer and want to access a web page, my computer recieves an HTML document that the browser
I am using can interpret to show me whatever content that particular page has to show me.
<br>
You could say that the <em>line of command</em> looks something like this:
<br>
<br>
<p align="center">
PERSON&lt;-&gt;COMPUTER&lt;-&gt;INTERNET&lt;-&gt;HTTP&lt;-&gt;SERVERS
</p>
<br>
In this example, HTTP is a type of protocol used to connect with servers, and servers are, as we all know, a kind
of computers, often holding a whole or parts of a web page, online game etc.
<br>
<br>
<b>Hyperlinks</b>
<br>
Web pages contain hyperlinks and as these can point me toward anything, be it pictures, videos, text, music or any
combination of these things, one can easily say that the anything can exist on the web, in one form or another.
<br>
<br>
<b>HTML</b>
<br>
HTML or <b><font color=blue>H</font></b>yper <b><font color=blue>T</font></b>ext <b><font color=blue>M</font></b>arkup <b><font color=blue>L</font></b>anguage
is the basic language of the internet. It contains:
<br>
<p align="center">
  HYPERLINKS, references to other content
  <br>
  TEXT content, which is basically what you read
  <br>
  MARKUP, defining what the above looks like
  <br>
  and it is a LANGUAGE
</p>
<br><br>
<b>Tags</b>
<br>
The Markup is made up of a load of <em>tags</em>, defining the way the content looks and what it does.
<br>
Most tags have an opening and a closing tag which show where it starts and where it ends. If the opening tag is <b>&lt;p&gt;</b>, the ending tag will be <b>&lt;/p&gt;</b>. 
All tags start with a &lt; and end with a &gt;. Thank you to boutell.com for showing me how
to write these in my code without the being a functional tag :-).
<br>An opening and a 
closing tag, with text content in between make up what is referred to as an <em>element.</em>
<br>
<br>
Basic tags are the <b>b</b> tag, which makes text come out <b>bold</b> on the screen and the <em>em</em> tag,
which makes text show up in <em>italics</em>.
<br>
<br>
Some tags are so called VOID tags. This means that they do not have an ending tag. An example is the IMG tag.
The IMG tag uses the URL to an image and displays it on the page. Here's one that I found with a quick google search. Thanks to 
imbreannarose.com for this:

<br>
<br>
<b>Whitespace</b>
<br>
If you want whitespace on your page, you need to use specific tags for this, as HTML only gives you one space, no matter how many clicks of
the spacebar you put into your code.
<br>
The one which may the most commonly used (but since my knowledge is limited, I am probably wrong about this) <b>br</b> tag, which gives you a
line-break. The br tag has no ending tag, and using one simply gives you the afore-mentioned line-break.
<br>
You can also use the <b>p</b> tag to create a <b>paragraph</b>. This has an opening and an ending tag and everything in between them is a part of the paragraph.
<br>
the br tag is a so called <b>inline</b> tag and the p tag is a so called <b>block</b> tag. As I understand it, the inline tag works on the line of text it is in
 while the block tag creates a kind of <em>invisible box</em> for it's content.
 <br>
 Another block element is the <b>div</b> tag while another inline element is the <b>span</b> tag. I am currently not quite sure how to use these,
 so I'm sure more will come up later :-).
 <br>
 <br>
 These are about all the notes I have from this first part of the course, although I did write something about the division of the HTML code into <b>HEAD</b> and <b>BODY</b>, things that I have 
 encountered before as I did do some HTML coding about 10 years ago, so I'm eager to catch up with previous knowledge and gain a lot of new things.
